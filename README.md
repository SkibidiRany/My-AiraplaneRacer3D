## üöÄ Project Overview

**AirplaneRacer3D** is a fast-paced, 3D airplane racing game built in Unity.  
**Game Objective:**  
Navigate your airplane through a series of different gates as quickly and accurately as possible. Each time you successfully pass through a gate, you earn points depending on its type: regular or golden. The challenge is to maximize your score by hitting every gate and finishing the course. At the end of the race, a scoreboard displays your results.

**Key Features:**
- Dynamic flight controls and responsive gameplay
- Realistic physics and immersive environments
- Gate-based scoring system with different gate types (regular, golden)
- End-of-race animation, scoreboard and performance summary

This repository is intended to demonstrate my contributions and technical skills, while respecting the NDA agreement with the client.

## üí° My Technical Approach

I was fully responsible for the technical architecture and core gameplay systems of the project.

- **Scalable & Maintainable Code:**  
  The codebase was designed for scalability and maintainability, following established software architecture patterns and best practices.
- **OOP Principles:**  
  I leveraged object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to ensure clean and modular code.
- **Serialization & Editor Friendliness:**  
  All gameplay parameters and settings are fully serialized, ensuring no "magic numbers" are used. This means everything can be tweaked and configured in the Unity Editor, making balancing and iteration simple and intuitive‚Äîcontrol is always just a click away.
- **Clarity & Understandability:**  
  Clean code practices, clear naming conventions, and thorough in-code documentation ensure the project is approachable for other developers and easy to extend in the future.
- **Technical Control:**  
  I managed all aspects of the core gameplay mechanics, systems, and technical architecture. My direct involvement in UI components and project management was limited, with my primary focus on the underlying technical implementation.

## üß© Code Snippets

Due to NDA restrictions, only a few representative snippets are included, you can check them in the Code-Snippets.cs file provided. 

Here is an example of how some events subscribe to certain actions. check how easy it is to change stuff! you don't even need to know how to code!
